    <h1>DailyIdea – about page</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Daily Idea!</strong> The goal of the site is pretty
      straightforward – provide a digital environment where users can submit
      their ideas or browse other people's ideas. The primary target audience is
      startup ideas, business ideas, or inventions.
    </p>
    <div class="mb-4">
      The mission of the site is to:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Be a place where you store your ideas so you can reference them later
          (like a diary)
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage you to get into the habit of regularly thinking of ideas
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
      Many people already store ideas in Evernote, Google Docs, Notes, text
      documents, other tools, etc. Daily Idea doesn't have to become the primary
      place people store ideas, it’s just another option that people can use.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to the other options, this allows people who want to share
      their ideas an easy way to do so and get inspire by other people's ideas.

      Creating ideas is a skill. And like any skill, it takes practice. Thinking
      of ideas every day strengthens your "idea muscle".
